## 2024

Currently using c++ for this year.

Code can be complied with the following commands depending on which compiler you use:

    g++ -O3 -Wall -o example example.cpp

or

    clang -O3 -Wall -o example example.cpp

Solutions use stdin for input and stdout to output the result.

When running the executable, pipe the input file into the executable:

    ./example < input.in
